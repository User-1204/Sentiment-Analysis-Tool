Deadass, I was absolutely shook when my snack of a friend decided to flex his ratio skills during the debate competition. He walked in with that signature sigma energy, radiating so much confidence that even the mid vibes of the audience couldn’t dampen his spirit. At first, the crowd seemed sus, casting skeptical looks and acting all salty, as if they’d already decided to be annoyed no matter what. But then, his rizz kicked in—effortlessly charming everyone with his wit and confidence, proving that he was anything but average.
As the debate heated up, a few salty critics tried to act woke and drop some cooked arguments, but my friend was ready. He outdone them all with sharp comebacks that left them ghosted—quietly ignored by the rest of the crowd. It was clear that their points, while desperate, were nothing but ick-inducing. The audience couldn’t help but stan my friend, and even those who had been pressed earlier were now cheering him on.
By the time the final round ended, the atmosphere was electric. You could see the thirst for victory in my friend’s eyes as he delivered his closing argument with dedication. For sure, he had achieved something incredible, leaving everyone either wept from emotion or completely cooked from the energy in the room. In that moment, it was obvious that he wasn’t just a participant—he was the embodiment of power, charm, and resilience. A true sigma in every sense of the word.
